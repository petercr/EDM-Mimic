# EDM WEB APP

## Project Goal
<strong>
    This project is a something I have been looking to work on for a long time,
    I thought of making something that would be challenging and something entertaining
    to make.<br>
    User can either press the keys on the keyboard or click the Keyboard (UI present on screen)
    to produce some Edm sounds. 
</strong>

### Features It Would Hold
    1.  Initially we could be playing sounds. 
    2.  Once that is completed, user could record the sound
        they produce.
    3.  More features like downloading and sharing to social media
        will be added after wards.
